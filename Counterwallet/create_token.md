Create a Token/Asset
---------------------------

You can create a token (also known as asset, coin, derivative) that is then owned by the address you choose. Ownership enables you to issue more units of your token, lock the supply, change the description, and customize other settings. Once the issuance is confirmed by the Bitcoin network, your tokens can be freely traded on the Counterwallet decentralized exchange against XCP and other tokens and (if you can convince them) centralized exchanges as well.

Tokens can be divisible or indivisible. Tokens that are not divisible will only exist in whole units (1,2,3,etc.) Divisible tokens support up to 8 decimal places. 

### There are two types of tokens:

**Alphabetical**

Alphabetical tokens (for example BACON) can be named, but must be between 4 and 12 uppercase letters and cannot start with A. To create an alphabetical token, you will need 0.5 XCP on the address you are using. This is an anti-spam fee, which aims to reduce the amount of names a single individual can register without significant costs.

**Numeric**

Numeric tokens are free, and only require a Bitcoin transaction fee (like all other Counterwallet actions). If you only want to create and trade numeric tokens, you will not require any XCP.

### Creating a token is fairly simple:

* Log in or create a Counterwallet
* Make sure your addresss has enough BTC for a transaction fee. (0.005 BTC)
* If you want to create an alphabetical token, your address will also need 0.5 XCP for the anti-spam fee.
* Click *"Address Actions"* on your address.
* Click *"Create a Token/Asset"*.

* Choose a type, description, quantity and divisiblity for your token. Note that the option to create an alphabetical token will only be available if the chosen address has 0.5 XCP available. You can create a description for your token, which can either be plain text, a URL to your tokenâ€™s official page, or a URL to a JSON file containing extended info.
