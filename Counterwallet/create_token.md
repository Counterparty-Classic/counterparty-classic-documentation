Create a Token/Asset
---------------------------

You can create a token (also known as asset, coin, derivative) that is ‘owned’ by the address you choose. Ownership enables you to issue more units of your token, change the description, and customize other settings. Tokens can be divisible or indivisible. Tokens that are not divisible will only exist in whole units (1,2,3,etc.) Divisible tokens support up to 8 decimal places.  

Creating a token is fairly simple. There are two types of tokens: 

### Alphabetical 

Alphabetical tokens can be named, but must be between 4 and 12 uppercase letters and cannot start with A. To create an alphabetical token, you will need 0.5 XCP on the address you are using.

### Numeric.

Numeric tokens are free, and only require a Bitcoin transaction fee (like all other Counterwallet actions). You can create a description for your token, which can either be plain text, a URL to your token’s official page, or a URL to a json with extended info.
