Counterwallet FAQ
==================

What is Counterwallet?
--------------------------

Counterwallet is an open-source web wallet for Bitcoin (BTC) and [Counterparty](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/) (XCP), the worldâ€™s first protocol for decentralized financial tools. Counterwallet handles transaction signing locally, which means that your passphrase and private keys never leave your browser. All trades and actions made with Counterwallet use a secure automatic escrow system within the Bitcoin blockchain, and as a result,no middleman is ever required.

Counterwallet is being actively developed and currently implements most Counterparty features.

- Fully functional wallet for BTC, XCP, and user-created tokens
- Peer-to-peer asset trading with algorithmic order matching (XCP, other assets)
- Custom asset creation
- Betting
- Broadcasting data on the Bitcoin Blockchain

Where can I access it?
--------------------------

Counterwallet hosted by the Counterparty project is available at [Counterwallet.io](https://counterwallet.io/). However, because Counterwallet source code is [open source](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/counterwallet/), anyone can host and alter their own instance of Counterwallet. Those instances, however, are not under control of Counterparty.io, so it is up to the user to assess reliability and trustworthiness of the host.

Where can I create addresses for different types of coins?
--------------------------

All Counterwallet addresses are regular Bitcoin addresses. Also, you can store BTC, XCP, and user created assets on any Bitcoin address as long as you have access to the private key.

(Altcoins that have their own blockchain, which is seperate from the Bitcoin blockchain, are not supported.)

I want to trade a certain asset, is it legitimate?
--------------------------

Assets/tokens are issued on the Bitcoin blockchain directly. This means that anyone with access to the internet is able to create and trade tokens freely without restrictions. There is no way to 'block' any Bitcoin addresses and transactions, which means that there is also no way to 'block' any Counterparty activity. We recommend significant due diligence and research before trading. Counterwallet does not filter any assets. Please check the official website of whatever asset/token you are planning to trade, and make sure to verify that it is legitimate. 

Is Counterwallet down?
-----------------------

Counterparty health status monitor is available [here](http://status-backend.counterparty.io/). Should the server you're connecting to be unresponsive or time out, you can try to directly access another of "cw" servers from this page. Counterwallet.io is a multi-server cluster so if one node is down it is likely that others may be up. It is also possible that Counterwallet is being updated, as it is constantly undergoing development.

Counterwallet is offline. Can I still access my funds?
-----------------------

Yes. You can mathematically generate your public and private keys using your passphrase. Since the addresses are generated on the fly using JavaScript, it is possible to do this in your own browser (even offline). You can use [this tool](https://blockscan.com/tool_generatekey). 

How does Counterwallet make profit?
-----------------------

It doesn't! Counterwallet development is a public service to the Counterparty and Bitcoin community. If you would like to contribute, you can click the donate button within Counterwallet itself. Or you can fork [the code](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/counterwallet/) and contribute that way.

Can I try Counterwallet on testnet?
------------------------------------------

Yes, you can test Counterwallet by using a testnet instance located at [testnet.counterwallet.io](https://testnet.counterwallet.io/). Once you log on, get some testnet Counterparty tokens from the faucet as explained on the welcome page.

Can I use Counterwallet with Armory?
------------------------------------------

Sure.

Add an address in an offline armory wallet, [here's how](https://bitcoinarmory.com/about/using-our-wallet/)
to your Counterwallet, and do something with the address (like send some XCP from that address), which will produce the armory unsigned transaction text. Copy it to a USB key, take it to your offline computer running Armory (which has the private keys), sign it on that computer via the Armory GUI, and then broadcast the signed transaction back in Counterwallet.

This will make use of assets owned in this address very secure... Basically Armory will act as cold storage of Counterparty assets, with almost the usability of a hot wallet.

What else do I need to know?
------------------------------

- All encryption is handled client-side. Neither your passphrase nor any of your private information ever leaves your browser. This also means that there is no password recovery, so make sure you do not lose your password.
- Because Counterwallet does not store your credentials, it has no access to your information if/when you are not logged in. If you log off or close your browser, any pending orders on the distributed exchange may not execute and you will have to resubmit your order and pay another transaction fee required for the underlying bitcoin transaction processing.
- Because of the US government regulations the betting functionality is limited to non-US-based client IP addresses.
