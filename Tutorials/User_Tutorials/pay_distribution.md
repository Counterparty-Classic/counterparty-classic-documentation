Making a distribution/dividend payment
---------------------------

When you have created or acquired ownership of a token, you will be able to make distribution payments. This feature can send XCP, BTC, or other tokens to the holders of your token. You can specify an amount per unit, and everyone who has units of your token will receive a proportional amount to their holdings. 

For example:

1. You create a token TRADEME with 100 total units.
2. You sell 25 TRADEME to user A.
3. You sell 25 TRADEME to user B.
4. Now you have 50 TRADEME, while both users have 25 each.
5. Next, you make a distribution payment of 0.001 BTC per unit.
6. User A will receive 0.025 BTC
7. User B will receive 0.025 BTC
