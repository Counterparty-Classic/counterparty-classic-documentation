Making a distribution/dividend payment
---------------------------

Distribution payments are a way of sending XCP, BTC, or other tokens to the holders of your token. You can specify an amount per unit, and every holding address of your token will receive a proportional amount to their holdings. 

For example:

* You create a token TRADEME with 100 total units.
* You sell 25 TRADEME to user A.
* You sell 25 TRADEME to user B.
* Now you have 50, and both users have 25 TRADEME.
* Next, you make a distribution payment of 0.001 BTC per unit.
* User A will receive 0.025 BTC
* User B will receive 0.025 BTC

When you have created or acquired ownership of a token, you will be able to make distribution payments.
