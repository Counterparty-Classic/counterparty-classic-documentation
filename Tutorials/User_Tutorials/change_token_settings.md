Change Token Settings
---------------------------

Once you have created a token, the address you have used will automatically be the owner of this token. This means that you will have access to certain token settings that can be changed. You can access these settings in Counterwallet by pressing the down arrow on the token's box.

**With ownership of a token you will be able to:**
* Change the token description
* Issue more tokens
* Lock the token in order to permanently and verifiably prevent more unit from being issued
* Transfer ownership
