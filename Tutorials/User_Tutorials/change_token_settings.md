Change Token Settings
---------------------------

Once you have created a token, the address you have used will automatically be the owner of this token. This means that you will have access to certain token settings that can be changed. You can access these settings in Counterwallet by pressing the down arrow on the token's box.

**With ownership of a token you will be able to:**
* Change the token description
* Issue additional units of your token
* Lock the token in order to permanently prevent more unit from being issued
* Transfer ownership of the token

### Issue additional tokens 
**If your token is not locked, you will be able to issue additional units of your token to increase supply. Click "Issue Additional" to do so.**

### Lock your token
**If you would like to create a verifiably finite token, you will have to lock your token to prevent more units from being issued. Click "Lock Token Issuance" to do so.**
