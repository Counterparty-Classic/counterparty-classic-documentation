Verifiable Voting with Tokens
---------------------------

Counterparty supports voting through user-created assets. If you create an asset (‘EXAMPLE’), you can create any other asset (such as EXAMPLEVOTE) and pay distributions of EXAMPLEVOTE to all holders of EXAMPLE automatically.

(distribution.md)
To send available votes to the holders of your asset, go to Counterwallet and click on your asset EXAMPLE, and then click pay distribution. Choose EXAMPLEVOTE as the currency to distribute. This way, all holders of EXAMPLE will receive EXAMPLEVOTE in the amount you specify.
Now all you need are as many different XCP addresses as there are choices in your poll. To cast their votes, holders of EXAMPLE can then send the EXAMPLEVOTE they have received to whichever choice(s) they agree with. The results of the poll will be public and verifiable thanks to the Bitcoin blockchain.
