Get Token Information
---------------------------

If you would like to learn more about a token you have, click on the down arrow in the token's box and then "Show Info".

You will then be able to see basic information about the token such as the description, total issuance, whether it is locked or divisible, and a brief history of the token.

If you want to see the information of any token at all, even if you are logged out, then you can use a [block explorer](http://blockscan.com) to search for the token.

In order to find out whether a token is legitimate, it is a good idea to check the comments section in the block explorer, the token's official website, and social media such as [Bitcointalk](http://bitcointalk.org).
