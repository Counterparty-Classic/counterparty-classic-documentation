Broadcast public information on the Bitcoin blockchain
---------------------------

Counterparty lets you publish text and data on the Bitcoin blockchain, called a 'broadcast'. This is useful for proof-of-publication, notary purposes, and creating betting feeds and oracles. This information is timestamped (as blocks), freely browseable and permanently stored on the Bitcoin blockchain. You can view and search broadcasts on a block explorer such as [Blockscan](http://blockscan.com/broadcast?p=0&g=&s=&text=&option=):
