Trading on the Decentralized Exchange
---------------------------

It is possible to trade on the Counterparty decentralized exchange directly inside Counterwallet. You can trade any token against any other token, including XCP. (Trading against BTC is planned for the near future.)

**Important:** But before you begin, please be aware this exchange inside Counterwallet is actually an interface to the Bitcoin network. This means that all tokens, buy, and sell orders are _all_ actually individual Bitcoin transactions. These transactions are then order matched by the protocol. This means that:

* **All buy and sell orders are automatically escrowed _in the Bitcoin blockchain_ itself until they are completed.** This means that there is never a third party or middleman (such as a server administrator, traditional exchange, clearing house, or bank). This kind of trading is called 'trustless', because you do not have to trust anyone to handle your trade correctly. The Bitcoin network takes care of that for you.

* Placing and cancelling orders requires the Bitcoin network to confirm these transactions, which may take some time.

* Each action requires a basic transaction fee (like any other regular Bitcoin transaction.)

* The entire system is decentralized and peer-to-peer. This means that the Counterparty decentralized exchange is always accessible to anyone with an internet connection, and is fundamentally uncensorable.

**Disclaimer:** 
All Counterwallet (and therefore Counterparty) actions are Bitcoin transactions. And because anyone can make a Bitcoin transaction, anyone can create a decentralized token. This means that Counterparty itself cannot distinguish whether tokens are legitimate, so please ensure due diligence before trading. Always research the official website of the token you are trading, its page on [Blockscan](http://blockscan.com) and (if applicable) its thread on [Bitcointalk](http://bitcointalk.org). If this concept seems confusing, consider that Bitcoin functions entirely without a central bank. This is an identical scenario.
