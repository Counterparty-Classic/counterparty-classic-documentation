# Software

**NOTE**: `counterpartyd` was recently split into two parts: `counterparty-lib` and `counterparty-cli`.

### [Counterparty CLI](/counterparty-cli.md)

`counterparty-cli` contains two command line scripts:
- `counterparty-server.py` (replaces `counterpartyd.py`)
- `counterparty-client.py` (replaces `counterparty-cli.py`)
