Build counterpartyd
===================

.. note::

  
  If you'd like to set up your own self-contained, full fledged Counterparty server (which is an Ubuntu Linux system that runs counterpartyd, counterblockd, and more), and/or want to run a Counterwallet server, follow the instructions `for building Federated Node <https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/Documentation/blob/master/build_federated_node.rst>`_ instead.
  

**Windows and Ubuntu Linux Users:** Follow the steps below to set up and run counterpartyd:

1. :doc:`Set up bitcoind </set_up_bitcoind.rst>`
2. :doc:`Build from Source </build_from_source.rst>`
3. :doc:`Set up Insight </setting_up_insight.rst>` (Optional)

These instructions make use of a build script that takes care of all setup necessary to set up counterpartyd from source on your system. Beyond this, the :doc:`Additional Topics </additional_topics.rst>` document contains useful information around operating counterpartyd, once installed.

**Non Windows/Ubuntu Linux Users:** If you are running an OS other than Windows or Ubuntu Linux, at this point you will need to follow the manual installation instructions `here <https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/counterpartyd/blob/master/README.md>`_.
