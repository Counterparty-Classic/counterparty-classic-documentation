Build counterpartyd
===================

.. note::

  
  If you'd like to set up your own self-contained, full fledged Counterparty server (which is an Ubuntu Linux system that runs counterpartyd, counterblockd, and more), and/or want to run a Counterwallet server, follow the instructions :ref:`federated-node` instead.
  

**Windows and Ubuntu Linux Users:** Follow the steps below to set up and run counterpartyd:

1. :ref:`setup-bitcoind`
2. :ref:`build-from-source`
3. :ref:`insight`

These instructions make use of a build script that takes care of all setup necessary to set up counterpartyd from source on your system. Beyond this, the Additional Topics document contains useful information around operating counterpartyd, once installed.

**Non Windows/Ubuntu Linux Users:** If you are running an OS other than Windows or Ubuntu Linux, at this point you will need to follow the manual installation instructions here.
