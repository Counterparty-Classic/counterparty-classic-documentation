Bounties
========

The Counterparty Project Bounties
---------------------------------

The Counterparty Projects offers bounties for various things, but
especially for security issues related to Counterparty software. You can
find more about those bounties here: http://counterparty.io/bounties/.

Community Bounties
------------------

From time to time community members create development bounties, too.

If you want to pay someone to develop a feature or fix a bug for you: 

- Ask in the chat or on the forums. If payment is in crypto, you can try to find a trusted community member to serve as 1-of-3 multisig senders.
- Create a bounty directly under particular issue, or create a bounty on http://bountysource.com/teams/counterparty/issues. Counterparty repos are integrated with Bountysource. 
- You can also use other sites and announce your bounties in the chat or on the forums
