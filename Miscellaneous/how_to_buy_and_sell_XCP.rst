How to Buy and Sell XCP and Counterparty listed Tokens
============================================================

Before buying or selling XCP and tokens, please read the Counterparty
and Counterwallet Terms of Use. They can be found at the bottom of the
Counterparty home page and are displayed every time you create a new
wallet on Counterwallet.io.

Centralized Exchanges
-------------------------------------------------------

Counterparty (XCP) is currently traded at the following centralized (crypto)exchanges (listed by volume as of January 2015): 

* `BTer`_ - buy/sell for BTC, CNY and USD (English, Chinese) 

* `Poloniex`_ - buy/sell for BTC 

* `Melotic`_ - buy/sell for BTC 

* `MasterXchange`_ - buy/sell XCP and any Counterparty-assets for BTC

* `ALTS`_ - buy/sell for BTC

**NOTE**: Centralized exchanges are controlled and operated by their
respective owners.

Counterparty Distributed Exchange
-------------------------------------------------------

The Counterparty distributed exchange matches orders algorithmically using the Bitcoin blockchain. This means that access is as unfilterable and unrestrictable as the use of Bitcoin itself. Therefore, due diligence is highly advised.

**NOTES**: 

(1) As you can see or deduce from the way Bitcoin works,
trading on the DEx is slower because each “move” (make offer, cancel
order, etc.) requires several confirmations on the Bitcoin blockchain.

(2) Because the CLI approach is not popular, it is expected that the
liquidity of BTC trading (because it is not accessible from
Counterwallet) is low. XCP and other assets are available from both the
CLI and Counterwallet.

Differences between Centralized and Distributed (Crypto)Exchanges
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  While the Counterparty DEx eliminates the counterparty risk and
   withdrawal limits, centralized exchanges often provide increased
   speed and lower fees (especially when trading bitcoin).
-  Counterwallet and counterpartyd CLI can be used with Armory.
-  “Buy and hold” users may therefore prefer to use the Distributed
   Exchange, while day-trading types may prefer traditional exchanges.

**NOTE**: Because the ability to buy and sell using bitcoin (aka “BTC
Pay”) was removed from Counterwallet on Nov 5, 2014, today DEx
tokens/assets are usually not denominated in BTC. BTC can still be
traded from the counterpartyd as explained in the how-to article above.
While that approach still suffers from the same inconveniences that
existed in Counterwallet, it does allow trust-less P2P trading with BTC
on the DEx.
